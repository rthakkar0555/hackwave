## System Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated multi-agent workflow as shown in the flow diagram:

<img src="./agent.png" title="Multi-Agent Flow" alt="Multi-Agent Flow" width="50%">

### Agent Specializations

1. **Domain Expert**: Analyzes business logic, industry standards, compliance requirements, and domain-specific knowledge
2. **UX/UI Specialist**: Handles user experience requirements, interface design, accessibility, and usability patterns
3. **Technical Architect**: Manages system architecture, technology stack, scalability, and implementation requirements
4. **Moderator/Aggregator**: Consolidates feedback from all specialists and resolves conflicts
5. **Debate Handler**: Analyzes and routes debates to appropriate specialists for efficient resolution

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

-   `frontend/`: Contains the React application built with Vite and TypeScript
-   `backend/`: Contains the LangGraph/FastAPI application with the multi-agent system

## Getting Started: Development and Local Testing

Follow these steps to get the application running locally for development and testing.

**1. Prerequisites:**

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm)
-   Python 3.11+
-   **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: The backend requires a Google Gemini API key.
    1.  Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
    2.  Create a file named `.env` by copying the `backend/.env.example` file.
    3.  Open the `.env` file and add your Gemini API key: `GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"`

**2. Install Dependencies:**

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**3. Run Development Servers:**

**Backend**
```bash
langgraph dev --allow-blocking
```
**Backend**
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the backend and frontend development servers. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend development server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/app`).

_Alternatively, you can run the backend and frontend development servers separately. For the backend, open a terminal in the `backend/` directory and run `langgraph dev`. The backend API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:2024`. For the frontend, open a terminal in the `frontend/` directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`._

## How the Multi-Agent System Works

The core of the backend is a LangGraph-based multi-agent system defined in `backend/src/agent/graph.py`. It follows these steps:

1. **Query Classification**: Analyzes user input to determine the most appropriate specialist agent(s) to handle the request
2. **Parallel Specialist Analysis**: Routes queries to Domain Expert, UX/UI Specialist, and/or Technical Architect based on classification
3. **Debate Detection & Routing**: Automatically detects debates and routes them to appropriate specialists for resolution
4. **Moderator Aggregation**: Consolidates feedback from all specialists and resolves any conflicts
5. **Final Answer Generation**: Creates a comprehensive, well-structured final answer based on all specialist analyses

### Debate Handling Workflow

The system includes sophisticated debate handling capabilities:

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies debate content through keyword analysis
- **Smart Routing**: Routes debates to the most appropriate specialist based on content analysis
- **Efficiency Focus**: Targets resolution in under 2 minutes for optimal productivity
- **Conflict Resolution**: Moderator agent resolves conflicts between specialist perspectives

### Model Configuration

The system uses **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** for all agent interactions, ensuring:
- **Consistent Performance**: Same model across all specialist agents
- **Optimized Speed**: Fast response times for real-time interactions
- **Cost Efficiency**: Single model reduces API costs
- **Reliable Results**: Consistent quality across all analyses

## API Endpoints

The system provides several REST API endpoints:

- `POST /api/refine-requirements`: Main endpoint for product requirements refinement
- `GET /api/health`: Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/agents`: Information about available specialist agents

## CLI Example

For quick testing, you can use the CLI example:

```bash
cd backend
python examples/cli_research.py "What are the requirements for a mobile banking app?"
```

## Deployment

In production, the backend server serves the optimized static frontend build. LangGraph requires a Redis instance and a Postgres database for state management and real-time streaming.

**1. Build the Docker Image:**
```bash
docker build -t multi-agent-requirements -f Dockerfile .
```

**2. Run the Production Server:**
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key> LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your_langsmith_api_key> docker-compose up
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8123/app/` to see the application.
