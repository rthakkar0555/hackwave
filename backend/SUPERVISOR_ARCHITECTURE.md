# Supervisor-Based Multi-Agent Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the refactored Supervisor-based multi-agent architecture for the Product Requirements Refinement System. The system has been transformed from a rigid graph-based workflow to a dynamic, Supervisor-controlled architecture that provides intelligent routing and coordination between specialist agents.

## Architecture Changes

### Before: Rigid Graph-Based Workflow
- Fixed routing between nodes
- All specialists always executed in sequence
- Limited flexibility for different query types
- Debate handling was a separate branch

### After: Supervisor-Based Dynamic Routing
- **Supervisor Agent** orchestrates the entire workflow
- Dynamic routing based on query content and current state
- Intelligent agent selection and sequencing
- Integrated debate handling within the Supervisor logic
- Real-time decision making and state management

## Core Components

### 1. Supervisor Agent
The Supervisor is the central orchestrator that:
- Analyzes the current state and user query
- Decides which specialist agent should act next
- Manages the workflow progression
- Handles debate detection and routing
- Determines when the analysis is complete

**Key Responsibilities:**
- State analysis and decision making
- Agent coordination and routing
- Workflow optimization
- Conflict resolution coordination

### 2. Specialist Agents
Each specialist agent is now a callable node that:
- Receives instructions from the Supervisor
- Performs domain-specific analysis
- Returns results to the Supervisor
- Maintains state consistency

**Available Specialists:**
- **Domain Expert**: Business logic, industry standards, compliance
- **UX/UI Specialist**: User experience, interface design, accessibility
- **Technical Architect**: System architecture, technology stack, scalability
- **Revenue Model Analyst**: Monetization strategies, pricing, business models
- **Moderator**: Aggregation, conflict resolution, final recommendations

### 3. State Management
Enhanced state structure includes:
```python
class OverallState(TypedDict):
    # Original fields
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    user_query: str
    query_type: QueryType
    # ... other analysis fields
    
    # New Supervisor fields
    active_agent: Optional[AgentType]
    supervisor_decision: Optional[SupervisorDecision]
    supervisor_reasoning: Optional[str]
    agent_history: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    current_step: int
    max_steps: int
    is_complete: bool
```

## Workflow Process

### 1. Initial Classification
```
User Query → classify_query → Supervisor
```

### 2. Supervisor Decision Making
```
Supervisor analyzes state and decides:
- CONTINUE: Route to next specialist
- END: Analysis complete, generate final answer
- DEBATE: Handle debate content
```

### 3. Dynamic Routing
```
Supervisor → [Domain Expert | UX/UI | Technical | Revenue | Moderator] → Supervisor
```

### 4. Completion
```
Supervisor → finalize_answer → END
```

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Routing
- **Intelligent Agent Selection**: Supervisor chooses the most appropriate agent based on query content and current state
- **Adaptive Workflow**: Different query types follow different analysis paths
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Avoids unnecessary specialist calls

### 2. Debate Handling
- **Integrated Processing**: Debate detection and routing handled by Supervisor
- **Specialist Assignment**: Debates routed to appropriate specialists based on content
- **Efficiency Focus**: Target resolution under 2 minutes

### 3. State Tracking
- **Agent History**: Complete record of all agent activities and decisions
- **Supervisor Reasoning**: Transparent decision-making process
- **Progress Monitoring**: Step-by-step workflow tracking

### 4. Streaming Support
- **Real-time Updates**: Frontend receives live updates as Supervisor coordinates agents
- **Agent Activity Streaming**: Each agent's activity is streamed to the frontend
- **Decision Transparency**: Supervisor decisions are streamed for visibility

## Implementation Details

### Graph Structure
```python
# Entry point
START → classify_query → supervisor

# Supervisor routing
supervisor → [domain_expert | ux_ui_specialist | technical_architect | 
             revenue_model_analyst | moderator_aggregation | analyze_debate | 
             finalize_answer]

# All agents return to supervisor
[all_agents] → supervisor

# Completion
finalize_answer → END
```

### Router Function
```python
def supervisor_router(state: OverallState) -> str:
    # Check completion conditions
    if state.get("is_complete", False):
        return "finalize_answer"
    
    # Get supervisor decision
    supervisor_decision = state.get("supervisor_decision")
    active_agent = state.get("active_agent")
    
    # Route based on decision
    if supervisor_decision == SupervisorDecision.END:
        return "finalize_answer"
    elif supervisor_decision == SupervisorDecision.DEBATE:
        return "analyze_debate"
    elif supervisor_decision == SupervisorDecision.CONTINUE:
        # Route to specific agent
        return agent_routing_map[active_agent]
```

### State Updates
Each agent updates the state with:
- Analysis results
- Agent history entry
- Processing time
- Step progression

## Benefits

### 1. Flexibility
